# Gradient Descent Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Gradient Descent Algorithm** in Python using NumPy. The algorithm demonstrates how to optimize the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`) of a line to minimize the error (using the Mean Squared Error) when fitting a dataset.

---

## Features

- **Implementation from Scratch**: No external machine learning libraries used.
- **Cost Function Calculation**: Computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) at each iteration.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: The code is simple and easy to understand for those new to machine learning.

## Code Highlights

The `gradient_descent` function performs the following:
1. Takes `x` (input feature array) and `y` (target values array) as inputs.
2. Iteratively updates the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`) to minimize the cost function.
3. Prints the intermediate values for:
   - Slope (`m`)
   - Intercept (`b`)
   - Cost (Mean Squared Error)
   - Iteration count

## Example Usage

Here's a dataset used in this example:

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

##output :
x = np.array([1, 2, 3,4,5])
y = np.array([5,7,9,11,13])

gradient_descent(x, y)
m = 0.062, b = 0.018000000000000002, cost = 89.0, iteration = 0
m = 0.122528, b = 0.035592000000000006, cost = 84.881304, iteration = 1
m = 0.181618832, b = 0.052785648000000004, cost = 80.955185108544, iteration = 2
m = 0.239306503808, b = 0.069590363712, cost = 77.21263768455901, iteration = 3
m = 0.29562421854195203, b = 0.086015343961728, cost = 73.64507722605434, iteration = 4
m = 0.35060439367025875, b = 0.10206956796255283, cost = 70.2443206760065, iteration = 5
m = 0.40427867960173774, b = 0.11776180246460617, cost = 67.00256764921804, iteration = 6
m = 0.4566779778357119, b = 0.13310060678206653, cost = 63.912382537082294, iteration = 7
m = 0.5078324586826338, b = 0.14809433770148814, cost = 60.966677449199324, iteration = 8
m = 0.5577715785654069, b = 0.16275115427398937, cost = 58.15869595270883, iteration = 9

After running for 10 iterations, the gradient descent algorithm converges:

Slope (m) approaches 1.9999 (which is very close to the true slope of 2).
Intercept (b) approaches 0.
This matches the true relationship y = 2x in the dataset.
